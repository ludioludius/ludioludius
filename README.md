## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ayush, and I'm a Computer Science major at UBC interested in building high quality software. 

- I'm currently working on finishing up [Image to Recipe Recommender]{https://github.com/ludioludius/image-to-recipe-recommender} - a web application that suggests recipes based on an image containing food ingredients.
- I'm always interested in learning more about the field, and I'm currently learning about more about Cloud, DevOps and test automation.
